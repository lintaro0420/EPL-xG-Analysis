# EPL-xG-Analysis

### Summary 

In this project, I've transformed data into dynamic visualizations that reveal more than just numbers. By examining the relationship between expected goals (xG) and actual goals scored, I've uncovered insights into who is outperforming their expected metrics and who isn't living up to them. 
 
Some of the key discoveries:

- Aston Villa's season shines through the data, with two players ranking in the top 10% for exceeding their expected goals. Interestingly, these aren't the players grabbing the daily headlines.
  
- Patterns emerged among players who are consistently underperforming against their xG, offering a unique lens through which coaches might reassess strategies and player utilization.
